DH-Forge (DH-F) is an open-source toolkit for wrangling character and game data for the Daggerheart™ TTRPG.

You can think of it as a common language that helps all sorts of digital tools—like character builders, virtual tabletops, and more—speak to each other seamlessly. Ultimately, this means your Daggerheart character information can move between different apps without details getting lost or mixed up, so you spend less time re-entering data and more time playing.

## Our Mission

TTRPG communities are bursting with creativity, not just in the thrilling tales we tell, but also in the tools we build to bring those stories to life.

Imagine a Daggerheart experience where all your tools work seamlessly together - your favorite character sheet app talking directly to your VTT, and sharing your homebrew creations digitally feeling like a natural extension of your game, rather than a side quest.

Currently, disconnected tools often form "data islands" that can slow down the fun. DH-Forge is here to bridge those islands and empower the Daggerheart™ community by offering: Interoperability, Homebrew Support, Openness, and Flexibility.

### Interoperable:
A shared way of understanding game data. This means you can (eventually!) move your character from a character builder app straight into your virtual tabletop session, smooth as silk.

### Homebrew-able:
A solid but flexible system designed to welcome your unique homebrew classes, legendary items, and terrifying monsters right alongside the core game elements.

### Open-Source:
A completely free and permissive (that's MIT licensed, for the curious) standard. Anyone can use it, build with it, and share their creations, whether it's a passion project or a commercial one.

### Flexible
A system that expertly handles all the core game data you'd expect, but is also designed to let you add your own extensions and features.

## Capabilities

So what Adventures Can This Unlock? When our tools speak the same language using DH-F, developers like you can craft a richer, more connected universe of Daggerheart™ experiences, like:
