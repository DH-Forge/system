DHFS (Daggerheart™ Forge System) is your open-source toolkit for wrangling character and game data for the Daggerheart™ TTRPG.

Think of it as a common language that helps all sorts of digital tools - character builders, virtual tabletops, and more - speak to each other seamlessly. No more awkward translations or lost-in-translation moments for your heroes!

## Our Mission

TTRPG communities are bursting with creativity, not just in the thrilling tales we tell, but also in the tools we build to bring those stories to life. We've all been there, though: your favorite character sheet app doesn't talk to your VTT, or sharing your homebrew creations digitally feels like a side quest in itself. These "data islands" can slow down the fun.

**DHFS is here to bridge those islands and empower the Daggerheart™ community by offering:**

 - **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work (Interoperability):** A shared way of understanding game data. This means you can (eventually!) move your character from a character builder app straight into your virtual tabletop session, smooth as silk.
 - **Your Game, Your Rules (Homebrew Support):** A solid but flexible system designed to welcome your unique homebrew classes, legendary items, and terrifying monsters right alongside the core game elements.
 - **Open Doors for Everyone (Openness):** A completely free and permissive (that's MIT licensed, for the curious) standard. Anyone can use it, build with it, and share their creations, whether it's a passion project or a commercial one.
 - **Built to Bend, Not Break (Flexibility):** A system that expertly handles all the core game data you'd expect, but is also designed to let you add your own extensions and features.

### What Adventures Can This Unlock?

When our tools speak the same language using DHFS, developers like you can craft a richer, more connected universe of Daggerheart™ experiences, like:

 - **Living Character Sheets:** Web or mobile apps that can beautifully display any character built with DHFS.
 - **Streamer-Friendly Overlays:** Automatically flash player stats on screen during your live games.
 - **Virtual Tabletops (VTTs):** Effortlessly import and export characters, beasties, and game elements.
 - **Digital Companions for Live Play:** Slick tablet apps for quick rule lookups and tracking initiative at the table.
 - **AI Story Weavers & Game Masters:** Feed structured data to AI tools to help generate new adventures or even assist the GM.
 - **And a Whole Realm More...:** Seriously, with a common way to handle data, the possibilities are extensive\!
