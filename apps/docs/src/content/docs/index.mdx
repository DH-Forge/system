## What is DHFS?

The Daggerheart™ TTRPG community thrives on creativity, both in gameplay and in the tools we build to support it. However, a common challenge is "data silos" – character sheets locked in one app, VTTs needing manual data entry, and homebrew content being difficult to share digitally.

**DHFS aims to solve these problems for the Daggerheart™ community by providing:**

-   **Interoperability:** A shared understanding of data structure, so you can move your character from your favorite builder to your virtual tabletop with ease.
-   **Homebrew Support:** A robust system for integrating homebrew classes, items, and more alongside core game rules.
-   **Openness:** A free and permissive (MIT licensed) standard that anyone can implement in their personal or commercial projects.
-   **Flexibility:** A system designed to handle the core game data while allowing for extensions.

## What It Enables

By adopting DHFS, developers can build a richer, more connected ecosystem of tools, including:
