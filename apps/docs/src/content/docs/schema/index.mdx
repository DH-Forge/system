Welcome, adventurer, to the world of JSON Schemas! This page is your quick start guide to understanding and using the raw DH-F Schemas that define Daggerheart™ game data. Whether you're building a character manager, a VTT integration, or just curious, you're in the right place.

We'll explore two main ways you can get a feel for these schemas:

1.  **[Autocomplete in Your Editor](#in-your-editor):** See how schemas provide autocompletion and validation as you type.
2.  **[Programmatic Validation](#programmatic-validation):** Understand how your code can use schemas to check if data is structured correctly.

Let's dive in!

## In your editor:

One of the neatest immediate benefits of JSON Schemas is how they can power up your code editor, giving you helpful hints and checks as you work with your Daggerheart™ JSON data.

Most modern JSON files can include a special line at the top: `"$schema": "URL_to_your_schema.json"`. This little line tells your editor (and other tools) where to find the "rulebook" (the JSON Schema) for this particular JSON file.

### Autocomplete Demo:

1.  Open your favorite code editor that has good JSON Schema support. We recommend [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  Create a new file, let's call it `my_character.json`.
3.  Paste the following into your new file:

<Code
	code={createCharacterSchema({name: "John Doe", level: 1})}
	lang="json"
	title="my_character.json"
	mark={["$schema"]}
/>

:::note
The `$schema` URL includes a version number, like `1.0.0`. You'll ideally replace this with the current version you intend to use from the [Available Schemas](#available-schema-versions) list below.
:::

**What You Should See (Fingers Crossed!):**

 - **Autocompletion:** Try typing a new property. As you type, your editor might suggest valid property names defined in the `character.json` schema (e.g., if you start typing `"level":` it should recognize if it's a valid field, and the type of value).
 - **Descriptions:** Hover over a property name like `"name"` or `"ancestry"`. The editor might show you a description of what that field is for, straight from the schema.
 - **Validation:** Try changing `"level": 1` to `"level": "boss"`. Your editor should flag this as an error because the schema expects `level` to be a number, not a string. Or, try deleting a required field – you might get a warning.

### Why This is Cool:

This immediate feedback loop is super helpful! It helps you:

 - Write valid Daggerheart™ data from the start.
 - Discover what properties are available and what they mean.
 - Catch typos and structural errors quickly, without needing to run any code.

:::caution[Heads-Up:]
While most popular editors support this, your editor might require specific plugins or configuration to get it working smoothly with remote URLs.

If it doesn't work out of the box, a quick search for "[Your Editor Name] JSON Schema support" might guide you.

## Programmatic Validation:

Editor assistance is great for when you're *writing* JSON, but what about when you need to handle JSON data in your code? That's where programmatic validation comes in.

### How it works:

Imagine you have a rest endpoint that returns a Daggerheart™ character as a JSON object. You also have the DH-F `character.json` schema. How can your program check if your character data actually follows all the rules set out in the schema?

That's the job of a JSON Schema validator library. You pick one for your favorite programming language, feed it:

1.  The DH-F schema (the rules).
2.  Your JSON data (e.g., the data you want to check).

The library then compares your data against the schema and tells you if it's valid. If not, it will usually provide a list of errors explaining what went wrong (e.g., "property 'level' is missing" or "property 'gold' should be a number but it was a string").

This is incredibly useful for:

 - Validating data submitted by users.
 - Checking data coming from external APIs or files.
 - Ensuring data is correct before saving it to a database or sending it to another system.

### Example with `ajv` and Javascript

For developers working in JavaScript (Node.js or the browser), [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) is a very popular and powerful JSON Schema validator. Here’s a simple example of how you might use it.

<Steps>

1.  **Install `ajv`** (if you're in a Node.js project):

    ```bash
    npm install ajv
    ```

2.  **Basic Validation Example:**

    ```javascript
     // Import Ajv
    import Ajv from "ajv";

    // Define the URL for the DH-F character schema
    const DHF_CHARACTER_SCHEMA_URL = "https://www.dh-forge.com/schema/0.0.0/character.json";

    // Main logic in an async function to use 'await'
    async function validateCharacterData() {
      console.log(`Fetching schema from ${DHF_CHARACTER_SCHEMA_URL}...`);
      let characterSchema;
      let validate;

      try {
        // --- Step 1: Fetch and Parse the Schema ---
        // Fetches the schema and parses it from JSON text into a JavaScript object.
        characterSchema = await fetch(DHF_CHARACTER_SCHEMA_URL).then(res => res.json());
        console.log("Schema fetched and parsed.");

        // --- Step 2: Initialize Ajv and Compile the Schema ---
        const ajv = new Ajv(); // Create an instance of the Ajv validator
        validate = ajv.compile(characterSchema); // Prepares the schema for efficient validation
        console.log("Schema compiled.");

      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to load or compile schema:", error.message);
        // Can't proceed if schema loading/compilation fails
        return;
      }

      // --- Step 3: Prepare Your Data ---
      // This data should be valid according to the 0.0.0/character.json schema.
      // (Actual fields depend on the specific 0.0.0 schema definition)
      const goodCharacterData = {
        name: "Hero Name", // Assuming 'name' is a required string
        // Add other fields as required by the 0.0.0 schema, e.g.:
        // concept: "A brave warrior",
        // ancestryId: "human_01"
      };

      // This data has intentional errors (e.g., wrong type for 'name')
      const badCharacterData = {
        name: 123, // 'name' should be a string
        // Other required fields might also be missing here
      };

      // --- Step 4: Validate Your Data ---
      console.log("\nValidating goodCharacterData...");
      if (validate(goodCharacterData)) {
        console.log("✅ Data is valid!");
      } else {
        // 'validate.errors' contains details about what's wrong
        console.log("❌ Data is invalid. Errors:", validate.errors);
      }

      console.log("\nValidating badCharacterData...");
      if (validate(badCharacterData)) {
        console.log("✅ Data is valid? (This is unexpected)");
      } else {
        console.log("❌ Data is invalid. Errors:", validate.errors);
      }
    }

    // Run the validation
    validateCharacterData();
    ```
</Steps>

#### Key Things to Note in This Example:

 - **Simplified Fetch:** The schema is fetched and parsed in a single line.
 - **Core Logic:** The example focuses on fetching, compiling the schema with `ajv`, and then validating data.
 - **Sample Data:** `goodCharacterData` and `badCharacterData` are illustrative. For the example to work correctly against the *actual* `0.0.0/character.json`, you'd need to ensure `goodCharacterData` provides all required fields with correct types as defined in that specific schema version.
 - **Error Info:** If validation fails, `validate.errors` is where `ajv` reports the issues.

#### Important Notes for Real-World Use:

 - **Schema Details:** The exact structure of `0.0.0/character.json` will determine what makes data "good" or "bad." Check the schema itself\!
 - **Error Handling & Caching:** Production code would need more robust error handling and likely schema caching.
 - **Consult Docs:** `ajv` and other validation libraries have many more features. Their official documentation is the best resource for advanced use.

The key takeaway is that JSON Schemas, combined with a validator library, give you a robust way to ensure data quality in any application, regardless of the programming language.

## What's Next?

Hopefully, this gives you a good starting point! We encourage you to:

 - Try the `$schema` trick in your editor with one of the character schemas.
 - Browse the list of [available schemas](/json-schema/versions) to see what data structures are defined.
 - If you're building something, think about how [schema validation](/json-schema/programmatic) could help your project.

Happy forging!
