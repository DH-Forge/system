Welcome, adventurer, to the world of JSON Schemas! This page is your quick start guide to understanding and using the raw DHFS Schemas that define Daggerheart™ game data. Whether you're building a character manager, a VTT integration, or just curious, you're in the right place.

We'll explore two main ways you can get a feel for these schemas:

1.  **Live in Your Editor:** See how schemas provide autocompletion and validation as you type.
2.  **Programmatic Validation:** Understand how your code can use schemas to check if data is structured correctly.

Let's dive in!

### Schemas in Your Editor with Instant Feedback!

One of the neatest immediate benefits of JSON Schemas is how they can power up your code editor, giving you helpful hints and checks as you work with your Daggerheart™ JSON data.

Most modern JSON files can include a special line at the top: `"$schema": "URL_to_your_schema.json"`. This little line tells your editor (and other tools) where to find the "rulebook" (the JSON Schema) for this particular JSON file.

#### Autocomplete Demo:

1.  Open your favorite code editor that has good JSON Schema support. We recommend [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  Create a new file, let's call it `my_character.json`.
3.  Paste the following into your new file:

<Code
	code={createCharacterSchema({name: "John Doe", level: 1})}
	lang="json"
	title="my_character.json"
	mark={["$schema"]}
/>

:::note
The `$schema` URL includes a version number, like `1.0.0`. You'll ideally replace this with the current version you intend to use from the [Available Schemas](#available-schema-versions) list below.

**What You Should See (Fingers Crossed!):**

 - **Autocompletion:** Try typing a new property. As you type, your editor might suggest valid property names defined in the `character.json` schema (e.g., if you start typing `"level":` it should recognize if it's a valid field, and the type of value).
 - **Descriptions:** Hover over a property name like `"name"` or `"ancestry"`. The editor might show you a description of what that field is for, straight from the schema.
 - **Validation:** Try changing `"level": 1` to `"level": "boss"`. Your editor should flag this as an error because the schema expects `level` to be a number, not a string. Or, try deleting a required field – you might get a warning.

#### Why This is Cool:

This immediate feedback loop is super helpful! It helps you:

 - Write valid Daggerheart™ data from the start.
 - Discover what properties are available and what they mean.
 - Catch typos and structural errors quickly, without needing to run any code.

:::caution[Heads-Up:]
While most popular editors support this, your editor might require specific plugins or configuration to get it working smoothly with remote URLs.

If it doesn't work out of the box, a quick search for "[Your Editor Name] JSON Schema support" might guide you.

## What's Next?

Hopefully, this gives you a good starting point! We encourage you to:

 - Try the `$schema` trick in your editor with one of the character schemas.
 - Browse the list of [available schemas](/json-schema/versions) to see what data structures are defined.
 - If you're building something, think about how [schema validation](/json-schema/programmatic) could help your project.

Happy forging!
