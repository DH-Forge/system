## The Challenge:
Daggerheart™ is all about making the game your own! But how do you make sure your custom-brewed Ancestries, Communities, or that new monster you designed can be understood by digital tools alongside the core ruleset?

## Why Solve It?
Homebrew is the lifeblood of many campaigns. Making it easy to integrate custom content digitally means more creativity, more sharing, and tools that truly reflect *your* version of Daggerheart™.

## Our Solution: Built for Your Unique Creations!
While rules and structure are what make shared systems like DHFS useful, we've designed it with a careful balance. DHFS isn't just about the core [Daggerheart™](https://www.daggerheart.com/) game elements; it’s built with the flexibility to robustly incorporate **your homebrew content**.

This means your custom classes, spells, items, and more can be defined in a way that other DHFS-compatible tools can understand, opening up rich, interoperable experiences for character builders, VTTs, streaming overlays, and all sorts of community-made apps.
