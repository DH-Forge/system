# DH Forge Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the DH Forge community, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free, inclusive, and positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We aim to foster an environment built on **Kindness**, a commitment to **Assuming Good Intent**, and a spirit of **Collaboration**. We believe these values honor the shared storytelling and inclusive experiences that **Daggerheart™** itself represents, and we strive to uphold them in all our interactions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and **kindness** toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting **constructive** feedback.
- **Assuming good intent** in others' actions and words, while being open to clarification.
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community and the DHFS project.
- Showing appreciation for the voluntary efforts of others – **nobody is paid to be here, so please be appreciative of the community support you receive.**
- Helping others learn – **when looking for support, share your context and learnings so others can learn from your experience.**
- Using welcoming and **inclusive** language.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment. This includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome comments or actions related to a person’s identity or beliefs.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission ("doxing").
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

**A Note on Harassment & Inclusivity:** DH Forge is committed to being a safe space. We take harassment and exclusionary behaviour seriously. Unacceptable behaviour, particularly harassment targeting community members, will not be tolerated, **even if it occurs on third-party platforms outside of official DH Forge spaces**, if it impacts a participant's ability to engage safely and productively with the DH Forge community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all official DH Forge project spaces, which currently include:

- The [DHForge GitHub Organization](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/DH-Forge) (including Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions).
- Any official DH Forge communication platforms (such as a future Discord server).

It also applies when an individual is representing the DH Forge community in public spaces.

## Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting **Ollie at ollie@dhfs.dev**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the reporter where possible, though full anonymity cannot always be guaranteed, especially if direct action involving the reporter is necessary.

Your report should ideally include:

- Your contact information (and your GitHub profile if relevant).
- The name/handle(s) of the individual(s) involved.
- A description of the incident.
- A link to the specific comment/conversation/log, or a screenshot if possible.
- The approximate time and date.
- Any other context or witnesses.
- Please state if you wish for your report to remain anonymous, and we will do our best to honor that request within the bounds of a fair investigation.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers (initially the BDFL, Ollie, until a governing body is formed) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Enforcement actions may include, but are not limited to:

- A private warning.
- Deletion or moderation of comments or other contributions.
- A temporary ban from one or all DH Forge community spaces.
- A permanent ban from one or all DH Forge community spaces.

We understand that DH Forge is a volunteer-run project with limited facilities. While our priority is to maintain a safe space for all participants, we will address issues to the best of our abilities within these constraints. We strive for fairness but may not always be able to provide solutions that satisfy everyone.
